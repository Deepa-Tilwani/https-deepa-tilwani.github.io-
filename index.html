							<p> The CDC statistics for Autism in US prevalence is 1 in 44, and more than one-third of people who suffer from stroke have Aphasia. As a result, there is substantial state-invested research interest in the form of the Institute of Mind and Brain (UofSC) for early detection of Autism and the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (UofSC). 
							These labs promote young researchers, motivated towards social good, to contribute in a practical effort to cater to the community, families, and children with signs of Autism. 
							I was fortunate to be selected as the first Jayana Clerk fellow to join the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Institute and work in conjunction with Drs. Amit Sheth, Jessica Bradshaw, Rutvik Desai, and Christian O'Reilly to learn about challenges in research about Autism and Aphasia, especially from the observational data gathered from people of South Carolina.

									<br>
								<br>It's a year spent collaborating with neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and practitioners in identifying multimodal markers of Autism in infants, which is even more challenging because of artifacts. 
								        Infants move too often and sensors placed on their body capture a lot of noise.  Moreover, for Autism, neuroplasticity in the early two years is fundamental and needs early diagnosis. 
									In Aphasia research, complexities lie in sparse longitudinal functional connectivity between brain regions.  These projects are also crucial for understanding the broader class of neurodevelopmental disorders, allowing health professionals to diagnose these diseases earlier and providing patients with a better treatment strategy. 
								        I am interested in creating data-driven models to allow simulation, analysis and inference of neurophysiological mechanisms over several brain scales that cause generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals. 
								<br>	
								<br>My contribution has been to develop user-explainable algorithms, visualization methods, and automated data process pipelines using AI fundamentals. Further, with the recent proliferation of research in AI to make it explainable and interpretable, my inclination to explore the brain using AI and expert knowledge can provide transparent algorithms for experts to use and reason. 
								        Researching the mechanisms underlying this trajectory has been extremely exciting. I am looking forward to the acceptance of our efforts in ACM Transactions of Computing for Healthcare. Furthermore, it has inspired me to explore deeper into the neurobiological intricacies of the brain, developing AI models, and human-AI teaming methods as a research career in my doctoral study on Infant Autism and Aphasia. 
								        As an outcome, this research can help cut the overall medical cost and have a better lifestyle.
